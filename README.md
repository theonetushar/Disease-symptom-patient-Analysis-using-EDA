# Patient Disease Dataset EDA

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a patient disease dataset using pandas. The goal is to gain insights and explore various properties of the dataset.

## Dataset

The patient disease dataset contains information about patients and their associated diseases. It includes the following variables:

- Disease: The type of disease the patient is diagnosed with.
- Fever: Presence of fever (yes/no).
- Cough: Presence of cough (yes/no).
- Fatigue: Presence of fatigue (yes/no).
- Difficulty Breathing: Presence of difficulty in breathing (yes/no).
- Age: Age of the patient.
- Gender: Gender of the patient.
- Blood Pressure: Blood pressure level of the patient.
- Cholesterol Level: Cholesterol level of the patient.
- Outcome Variable: Outcome variable related to the patient's disease.

## Approach

In this project, we utilize the power of pandas, a popular data manipulation and analysis library in Python, to perform EDA on the patient disease dataset. By leveraging pandas' functionalities, we gain insights into the dataset, explore its structure, and analyze various properties of the data.

## EDA Techniques

The EDA techniques employed in this project include:

1. Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming the data if necessary.
2. Descriptive Statistics: Calculating summary statistics, such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation, to gain an understanding of the data distribution.
3. Data Visualization: Creating visualizations, such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and bar plots, to visualize the relationships, distributions, and patterns in the data.
4. Correlation Analysis: Examining the correlations between variables using techniques like correlation matrices and heatmaps to understand the interdependencies among different attributes.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib`
3. Open the project in your preferred Python environment.
4. Run the code and explore the EDA results.

## Conclusion

By leveraging pandas and employing various EDA techniques, this project provides insights into the patient disease dataset. The visualizations and analyses performed contribute to a better understanding of the dataset's properties and relationships between different variables.
